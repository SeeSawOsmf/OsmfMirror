	/**
	 * IPluginInfo is the encapsulation of the set of IMediaInfo objects
	 * that will be available to the application after the plugin has been
	 * successfully loaded.
	 * Every Open Source Media Framework plugin must implement this interface
	 * to provide the application with the information it needs
	 * to create and load the plugin's MediaElement.
	 * <p>
	 * From the point of view of the Open Source Media Framework,
	 * the plugin's purpose is to expose the IMediaInfo
	 * objects that represent the media that the plugin handles.
	 * These MediaInfo objects could describe standard media types such as
	 * video, audio, or image that can be represented by the built-in Open Source Media Framework
	 * MediaElements: VideoElement, AudioElement, or ImageElement.
	 * More likely, a plugin provides some type of specialized processing,
	 * such as a custom loader or special-purpose media element with
	 * customized traits. 
	 * For example, a plugin that provides tracking might implement
	 * a TrackingCompositeElement that includes a customized loader and customized
	 * IPlayable and IPausible trait implementations that start and stop tracking
	 * as well as the video.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>An IPluginInfo also gives the plugin an opportunity to accept or reject a specific
	 * Open Source Media Framework version through its <code>isFrameworkVersionSupported()</code> method.</p>
	 * <p>A dynamic plugin is loaded at runtime from a SWF or SWC.
	 * A static plugin is compiled as part of the Open Source Media Framework application.
	 * An application attempting to load a dynamic plugin accesses the class
	 * that implements IPluginInfo through
	 * the <code>pluginInfo</code> property on the root of the plugin SWF.
	 * If this class is not found,
	 * the plugin is not loaded.
	 * An application attempting to load a static plugin instantiates a class
	 * from the class reference
	 * of its PluginClassResource class
	 * and casts the instance to a PluginInfo. </p>
	 * <p>The following code ilustrates a very simple IPluginInfo implementation:</p>
	 * <listing>
	 * public class SimpleVideoPluginInfo implements IPluginInfo
	 * {
	 * 		public function SimpleVideoPluginInfo()
	 * 		{
	 * 		}
	 * 
	 * 		// Returns the number of MediaInfo objects the plugin exposes.
	 * 		public function get numMediaInfos():int
	 * 		{
	 * 			return 1;
	 * 		}
	 * 
	 * 		// Returns the MediaInfo object at the specified index position.
	 * 		public function getMediaInfoAt(index:int):IMediaInfo
	 * 		{
	 * 			var netLoader:NetLoader = new NetLoader();
	 * 			return new MediaInfo("org.openvideoplayer.video.Video", netLoader,
	 * 				 VideoElement, new Array(netLoader));
	 * 		}
	 * 
	 * 		// Return if the plugin supports the specified version of the framework.
	 * 		public function isFrameworkVersionSupported(version:String):Boolean
	 * 		{
	 * 			return true;
	 * 		}
	 * }
	 * </listing>
	 * @see PluginClassResource
	 * @see PluginFactory
	 * @see org.openvideoplayer.media.IMediaInfo
