	/**
	 * ILogger interface defines the capabilities of a logger, the 
	 * object that OSMF applications interact to write logging messages.
	 * 
	 * Logging messages are designated with the following levels
	 * 
	 * DEBUG: Designates informational level messages that are fine 
	 * 		grained and most helpful when debugging an application.
	 * 
	 * INFO: Designates informational messages that highlight the progress 
	 * 		of the application at coarse-grained level.
	 * 
	 * WARN: Designates events that could be harmful to the application operation.
	 * 
	 * ERROR: Designates error events that might still allow the application 
	 * 		to continue running.
	 * 
	 * FATAL: Designates events that are very harmful and will eventually lead 
	 * 		to application failure.
	 * 
	 * The message logging functions take the format of 
	 * 	function_name(message:String, ...rest):void
	 * 
	 * Where:
	 * 		message:String — The information to log. This string can contain 
	 * 			special marker characters of the form {x}, where x is a zero 
	 * 			based index that will be replaced with the additional parameters 
	 * 			found at that index if specified.
	 * 
	 * 		...rest — Additional parameters that can be subsituted in the str 
	 * 			parameter at each "{x}" location, where x is an integer (zero based) 
	 * 			index value into the Array of values specified. 
	 * 
	 * 			for instance:       
	 * 				logger.debug("here is some channel info {0} and {1}", 15.4, true);
	 * 				This will log the following String:
	 * 					"here is some channel info 15.4 and true"
	 *  
	 *  @langversion 3.0
	 *  @playerversion Flash 10
	 *  @playerversion AIR 1.5
	 *  @productversion OSMF 1.0
