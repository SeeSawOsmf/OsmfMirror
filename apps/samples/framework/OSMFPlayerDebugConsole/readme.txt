This project is part of the OSMFPlayer project. It defines an AIR application that listens to the OSMFPlayer emitting debugging messages.

Usage

* Compile the application, and run it outside of Flex Builder.
* Compile the OSMFPlayer application, and run it. On media loading and playing back, debug messages will appear on the debug console.

OSMFPlayer debug console support can be disabled by changing the OSMFPlayer project's compiler arguments to "-define CONFIG::DEBUG false".
