This project is part of the WebPlayer project. It defines an AIR application that listens to the WebPlayer emiting debugging messages.

Usage

* Compile the application, and run it outside of Flex Builder.
* Compile the WebPlayer application, and run it. On media loading and playing back, debug messages will appear on the debug console.

WebPlayer debug console support can be disabled by changing the WebPlayer project's compiler arguments to "-define CONFIG::DEBUG false".
